# Playwright Base Template

My basic stuff for a new playwright test install

## Install

```bash
 git clone <repo>
 yarn/npm/pnpm install
 npx install playwright
```

## To run tests

All tests should be run from the top level directory.

```bash
npx playwright test
```

See package.json for helpful scripts.
