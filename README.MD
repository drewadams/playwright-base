# Playwright Base Template

My basic stuff for a new playwright test install

## Install

```bash
 git clone <repo>
 npm install
 npx install playwright
```

## To run tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Some premade scripts

```bash
 npm run test = "npx playwright test",
 npm run test:vis = "npx playwright test vis-comp",
 npm run test:lh = "npx playwright test lighthouse",
 npm run debug = "npx playwright test --debug"
```
